ThemeRoot does it's best to find and produce high quality content, but ThemeRoot does not take responsibility for code in projects cataloged on the Themeroot.com website that we did not write ourselves. It is the responsibility of the user to inspect and review all code prior to production use to ensure the code is secure and not full of errors. ThemeRoot.com is an open source repository itself, so we do not provide any warranty with the themes and other code we catalog on our website.
