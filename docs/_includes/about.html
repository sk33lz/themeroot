			<h2>What is ThemeRoot?</h2>
			<p>ThemeRoot is mainly an open source library of open source themes for today's top Content Management Systems like Drupal and Wordpress, but we also catalog open source CSS templates and open source themes for today's top static site generators. ThemeRoot also catalogs free theming resources like web fonts, tools, and guides.</p>
			<p>We have taken the site fully open source on GitHub, which will allow us to accept project submissions faster once we get a good workflow in place. We are accepting GPL Creative Commons, Apache, MIT, and any other type of open source compatible licensed projects through our GitHub issues page.</p>
