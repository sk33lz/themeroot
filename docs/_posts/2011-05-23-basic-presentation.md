Basic Presentation is a port of a free HTML/CSS website template available designed by <a href="https://andreasviklund.com/">Andreas Viklund</a> into a Drupal theme. It is another great minimal HTML/CSS template from Andreas, which ends up being a very clean theme in Drupal and easy to modify.

Basic Presentation includes a PSD for further customization to the background image and the header image. You can get the source files over at the [Basic Presentation homepage](https://andreasviklund.com/dt_portfolio/basic-presentation/).

## Basic Presentation Features

- 2 Column Layout
- Left Sidebar
- Primary Menu on Left Sidebar
- Secondary Menu in the Footer
- 4 Column Feature Area below the Main Content Area.

## Future Plans

- Include the [alternative Basic Presentation layout](https://andreasviklund.com/basic-presentation-alt/).
- Add more Drupal theme regions.
- Implement the color changer like Garland has.
- Make responsive.
- Upgrade to Drupal 8.
