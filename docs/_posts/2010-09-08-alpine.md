Alpine is a GPL v3 Wordpress theme by the same name that I converted to Drupal 6 originally, but have since upgraded to Drupal 7.

I have already added some extra regions and plan to add more in later versions. There is also a 100% CSS Only Primary Links menu dropdowns for Drupal 6 and Main Menu drop downs for Drupal 7. Alpine features some great default images and styles, but can be easily modified with your own images. It is great for a nature blog, hiking blog, and generally any other outdoors or nature related website.

## Features

- Drupal 7 Release Now Available!
- Pure CSS Primary Links Menu Dropdowns
- Top and Bottom Content Regions
- 2 Column Layout
- Left Sidebar
- Large Header Image - Easily Modified!

## Future Plans
- Create more Content/Block Regions.
- Create more default color templates.
- Make responsive. 
- Upgrade to Drupal 8.
