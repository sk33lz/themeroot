Glassical is a GPL Wordpress theme of the same name that was released by <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/11/07/glassical-a-free-wordpress-theme/" ref="nofollow">Smashing Magazine</a> and created by <a href="http://www.symmetricweb.com/" rel="nofollow">Abdullah Ibrahim</a> originally.

Glassical was originally ported to a Drupal 6 theme, but has since been upgraded to a Drupal 7 theme.

I have added 2 useful extra content/block regions and plan to add more soon.

## Features

- Added Content Top & Content Bottom Content Regions
- 2 Column Layout
- Right Sidebar
- Pure CSS Primary Links Menu Dropdowns
- Neato CSS 3 Text Shadow effects

## Future Plans

- Make responsive.
- Upgrade to Drupal 8.
