SkeletonCraft is a Responsive Drupal 7 theme that I have been using for a while on Minecraft related sites that I administer. I have gotten it to a point that I really like, and it's time to release it into the wild.

## Features
- Uses the Skeleton CSS Boilerplate as a base for a responsive, mobile friendly layout.
- Fully integrated with [TinyNav](http://drupal.org/project/tinynav) module out of the box. (Required for Mobile Navigation to work properly) Install and enable the [TinyNav](http://drupal.org/project/tinynav) module and you are good to go.


**Please Note:** There is currently a major bug in [TinyNav 1.2](https://drupal.org/node/1967636), the current release, so please use [TinyNav 1.1](https://drupal.org/node/1793642) until further notice.

I did all of the artwork for this theme. It's not the most beautiful work of art, but it resembles the look of Minecraft with large pixel artwork. I will probably make updates to the artwork at some point to give it a better repeating pattern for the background. This was my first attempt.

Thanks to [sirkitree](https://drupal.org/user/59025) for the logo!
