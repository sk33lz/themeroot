EarthlingTwo is Creative Commons HTML/CSS template we have converted to a Creative Commons Drupal theme that was designed by <a href="http://nodethirtythree.com">NodeThirtyThree</a> and created by <a href="https://templated.co/">FreeCSSTemplates.org</a>. NodeThirtyThree has some pretty sick open source CSS template designs and we are looking to convert as many of their designs as we can to [Creative Commons Drupal themes](/drupal-themes). The theme was originally converted to Drupal as a Drupal 6 theme. We hope to update it to a Drupal 7 theme as well at some point.

## Features

- Beautiful Design, Clean Design.
- 2 Column Layout.
- Pure CSS Primary Menu Dropdowns.
- Customizable Header Graphic on the Theme Settings page.

## Plans for the Future

- Add more Block Regions.
- Update to a Drupal 7 theme.
- Update to a Drupal 8 theme.
- Add CSS 3 styling.
- Create PNG Sprites for all images to increase theme performance.

## Demo

Working on a new demo...

Please file any issues or feature requests in the [EarthlingTwo Github Issue queue](https://github.com/sk33lz/earthlingtwo/issues).

Thanks and Enjoy the Drupal EarthlingTwo theme!
