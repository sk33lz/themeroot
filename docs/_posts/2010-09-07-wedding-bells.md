Wedding Bells is a GPL theme by <a href="https://www.lauriliimatta.com/">Lauri Liimatta</a> that was ported from Wordpress to Drupal 6 originally, but has since been upgrade to Drupal 7. I did my best to keep it exactly like the original theme. This is one of my first ported Drupal themes, so please share any criticisms or suggestions for improvement in the issue queue.

I plan to add several more regions to the theme to make it a more versatile theme for block and content configurations. The included header image can easily be changed out to an image of your choice, which can instantly change the overall theme of the site without much other work.

## Features

- Fully XHTML and CSS Valid
- Pure CSS Dropdown Menus

## Future Plans

- Add extra regions to make the theme more versatile.
- Make responsive.
- Upgrade to Drupal 8.
