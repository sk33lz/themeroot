Designer Relief is a Wordpress theme that was originally ported to a Drupal 6 theme. It has since been upgraded to a Drupal 7 theme. It is very well put together for a blog theme and has some customizations done to the page.tpl and node.tpl files to allow for the date and comments to be displayed differently than they normally are in themes. It's very close to the original Wordpress theme, but has a few minor adjustments to make yet. I would say that it is 95% completely converted. I did add a new region to the theme, which was perfect for the Primary Links. It is located across the top of the theme in the wood area. Feel free to post feedback either positive or negative about the theme as I look to improve on it over time as well.

## Features
- Blog Theme
- 100% CSS Menu Dropdowns
- Fixed Width
- 2 Columns

## Future Plans

- Add More Block Regions.
- Make responsive.
- Upgrade to Drupal 8.
