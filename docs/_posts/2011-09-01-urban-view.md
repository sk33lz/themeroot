The Drupal Urban View theme is a port of a Wordpress theme by the same name. The theme is mostly complete, but I still have a few things that I want to fix to make it more user friendly and more accurate to the original theme.

Please feel free to post issues you find in the [Drupal issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/urban_view?categories=All). I have added a known issues list below so those who try out the theme know what to look for.

## Features

- 2 Columns
- Fixed Width
- Right sidebar
- Blog Theme

## Known Issues

Primary Links are not automatically placed in sidebar. I will be adding it to the right sidebar.
Sidebar is not a default Drupal sidebar syntax. I need to add sidebar_right instead of just sidebar.

## Future Plans

- Update to Drupal 8.
- Add more Block Regions.
- Make responsive.
